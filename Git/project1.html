                  I am Pradeep Meena, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech).
                  My educational journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as 
                  Java, C, and C++. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have delved into the realm of web development,
                  honing my skills in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. Through hands-on projects and coursework, 
                  I have developed a keen understanding of software development principles and best practices. 
                  With a passion for continuous learning and innovation, 
                  I am eager to contribute my technical skills and enthusiasm to real-world challenges.
